              The lyceum in Likhachiv village. Ukraine. At the beginning of the war in 2022, this
              lyceum was damaged by shelling. Therefore, Brave to Rebuild Foundation and the
              European Commission decided to restore it. And not just restore it, but create an art
              installation. They invited me as an artist to create a mural on the facade of the
              school.The school itself was built nearly 100 years ago, in 1927, using an ancient
              Ukrainian technology of clay houses.

              Rebuild” community and local residents worked together to ensure that the school could
              reopen its doors. In this mural, I combined traditional Ukrainian painting with a

              The echo glows, reflecting the sunlight, and somewhere there burns a star that will
              show the way forward. The storks fly off to warm lands, but for someone, it's time to
              stay at home. He, like Atlas, firmly holds the sun that shines on all of us. He cannot
              give in to the waves that try to knock him down. In him shine all those stars—the
              souls he has saved. Soon, the fern will bloom for him, bringing happiness and peace.
              The wreaths set afloat on the water, to find love, will reach their future owner.

                A transformed Javelin — turned into an art object after being used on the
                battlefield. Created for an auction at the House of Cinema in Kyiv, Ukraine. The
                piece is rich with symbolism. The eyes represent the idea that the universe — and
                justice — sees all. Nothing goes unnoticed, and everyone will ultimately receive
                what they deserve. The viburnum (kalyna) is a powerful Ukrainian symbol of national
                identity and deep-rooted heritage. It speaks to our cultural consciousness and
                connection to the land.

                The burrs symbolize human flaws and vices — the inner obstacles we must overcome in
                order to build a better world. All elements are interconnected: our actions and
                their consequences, our labor and its outcome. This connection is visually expressed
                through entwined vines painted across the object — a metaphor for the invisible
                threads that bind cause and effect, self and society, destruction and rebirth.
