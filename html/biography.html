              <p class="biography-list-txt">
                Sofiia Kandaurova was born and raised in Kyiv, Ukraine.</br>
                After the beginning of the Russian invasion in 2022, she was forced to evacuate from her home country — first to
                Poland, then back to Ukraine, and eventually to Japan.</br>
                Sofiia graduated in 2023 from Kyiv University of Culture.
                Since 2016, she had been a member of the VillGanovski Art
                Studio, where she spent six years developing her own ideas 
                and artistic style.</br>
                In 2023, Sofiia completed a course in 
                traditional Ukrainian painting known as “Kyiv painting.” As a 
                result, her works reflect a fusion of contemporary themes and
                traditional ornaments.</br>
                She now lives and works in Kyoto, Japan.

              <h2 class="biography-list-title-2">Artist statement</h2>
              <p class="biography-list-txt-2">
                The central theme of my artistic practice is the search for 
                one’s place in the world. I explore emotions such as 
                disorientation, uncertainty about the future, and a deep sense 
                of loneliness. These feelings often manifest in my figures — 
                faceless, fragmented, as if torn apart by their own fears and 
                inner conflicts. They lack wholeness, yet they instinctively 
                reach out to one another, driven by a quiet hope to find 
                connection and harmony amidst the chaos.</br>
                </br>
                Equally important in my work is the relationship between 
                humans and nature. In an age dominated by technology and
                social media, we are slowly drifting away from reality, losing
                touch with our surroundings and ourselves. Through my art, I 
                strive to reawaken this bond. Nature appears not just as a 
                background, but as a living force — a mirror and a guide in the 
                internal journey toward balance and self-discovery.
                My work reflects a deep longing to reconnect: with others, 
                with the natural world, and with the forgotten parts of 
                ourselves.
